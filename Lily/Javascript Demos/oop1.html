        //The difference between JavaScript's prototype chain and Java's Class 
        //is that it doesn't have the concept of "Class", all objects are instances, 
        //and the so-called inheritance relationship is just the prototype of one object 
        //pointing to another object.

        //You can change xiaoming from Student to Bird, or to any object during the JavaScrip code runtime.

        //Please note that the above code is for demonstration purposes only. 
        //When writing JavaScript code, do not use obj.__proto__ directly to change the prototype of an object, 
        //and, __proto__ is not available in lower versions of IE.
        // the Object.create() method can pass in a prototype object and create a new object based on that prototype, 
        //but the new object has no properties whatsoever, so We can write a function to create Tom

        // prototype:
        var Student = {
            name: 'Robot',
            height: 1.2,
            run: function () {
                console.log(this.name + ' is running...');
            }
        };

            // Create a new object based on the Student prototype:
            var s = Object.create(Student);
            // Initialize new object:
            s.name = name;
            return s;
        }
